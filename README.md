This is a simple multi-screen Recipe Explorer app built with Jetpack Compose. It displays a list of recipes and shows detailed information when a recipe is selected. The layout adapts automatically for phones (with navigation) and tablets (with a split-screen view).

To run the app, open the project in Android Studio and click the green "Run" button on an emulator or physical device.
